\section{The 419 corpus}

In this section we introduce the 419 corpus -- a collection of $32,000$ advance fee fraud email messages in 22 classes. We have constructed this corpus from freely available data on antifraudintl.org over the course of a week using a crawler, a scraper and a set of preprocessing techniques. Email messages in the corpus span a period of 5 years -- between January 2007 and January 2012.  Each message contains the following information:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item A minimal set of headers -- \emph{Subject}, \emph{From} and/or \emph{Reply-To} address.
	\item An extended set of headers -- these vary, but may contain \emph{Return-Path}, \emph{Received}, \emph{Date}, \emph{X-Originating-IP}, etc.
	\item A message body -- the contents of the email message
	\item Scam class -- e.g. \emph{Lottery}, \textit{Next of kin}, etc. See table [TABLE].
	\end{itemize}

The original data has been preprocessed heavily to construct the corpus. Using the information extraction techniques in [CHAPTER], we have discarded over $11,000$ malformed messages -- i.e., messages that do not contain the minimal set of headers, a message body or are not emails. This represents $25.6%$ of the original data. In addition to this, we have grouped similar classes together -- e.g., there is no need for separate \textit{Romance scam} and \textit{Russian romance scam} labels. This reduced recognized classes from 31 to 22.
