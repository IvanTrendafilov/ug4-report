\chapter{Collectors}

In this chapter we outline our system's mechanism for collecting new messages. We first set up the context and motivation of the problem. Then, we explore the implementation of our solution. Lastly, we describe three specific modules which implement the collector interface.

\section{Motivation}


The collectors component provides point of entry into the system and has two main functions. First, it monitors all email boxes used by the agent for new messages. Second, crawls and scrapes for new AFF messages.

This chapter details the functionality and implementation of the response generation component. As emphasized in sections [SECTION], [SECTION], response generation depends on the outputs of the information extraction, classification, and identity generation components.
